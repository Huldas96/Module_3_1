Hello! 

Here you can find four different .scss files that include my learnings of sass!
I made nice chuncks of comments explaining what I learned these last days and made a few examples.
So please go over the files, there are comments that explain in more detail. 
Here is an overview of what to expect in the files:

    - main.scss: Here I combine all I learned and show a few examples using veriables, maps, mixins and extend!

    - _typo_styles.scss: Here I show what I learned about variables and maps!

    - _mixins.scss: Here I show what I learned about mixins!

    - _extend.scss: Here I show what I learned about extend!

Thanks for reviewing!
